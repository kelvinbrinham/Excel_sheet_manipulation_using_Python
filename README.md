# Excel_sheet_manipulation_using_Python
Here I collect relevant equity data from 5 differently formatted Excel sheets and output them in one final organised Excel sheet.

There are several scripts, but you only need to run Creating_Output_Spreadsheet.py (the other scripts read the input spreadsheets and are called in 
Creating_Output_Spreadsheet.py)

Instructions:

1. Run Creating_Output_Spreadsheet.py. The output spreadsheet is put into the 'Data_Formatted' folder and is called 'Combined_OUTPUT.xlsx' by default.
